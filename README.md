# Financial Dashboard with Python

By the power of Python and Bokeh, you can easily run a dashboard with all sorts of tools at your disposal to pull from stock APIs and compare data. This project is a simple demonstration using Yahooâ€™s public Pythonic tool of what can be done, and may be updated in the future to further demonstrate what you can do with it. 

Note: for this example, I used the yfinance module. You can use ANY model for any API for your needs. You can also use CSV files to plot data.
